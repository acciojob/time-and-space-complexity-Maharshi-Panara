	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, allowing developers to choose the most efficient one for their needs.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a linear space complexity is denoted as O(n), meaning that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
